# Newsweek Repsonsive Design using Bootstrap

> Newsweek page clone built using Bootstrap

This is part of the first module in Microverse on HTML and CSS, where my partner and I had to clone the [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/) page using Bootstrap as our CSS framework. The page is fully responsive and should look exactly like the original one.
